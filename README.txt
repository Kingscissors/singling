By Jonathan Vasquez (FearedBliss)
Released on Sunday, September 22, 2013
------------------------------------------------

This is a light addon to improve the Single Player experience. The below features are just things that the
Single Player Forum (SPF) at Diablo IncGamers already accept.

Overall this serves as a consolidation of FAM (Forum Accepted Mods).

1.09b/d Features:
-----------------

- Runes are now colored orange just like in 1.13.

- You can now run multiple clients of Diablo II.

1.13d Features:
-----------------

- Ladder Runewords are now enabled/unlocked and can be used on Single Player.

- You can now run multiple clients of Diablo II.
