Singling 1.1.0 for 1.07 - 1.13d
By Jonathan Vasquez (fearedbliss)
Released on Sunday, June 29, 2014
------------------------------------------------

1.1.0
-------------------
- Added support for 1.09a/b, 1.10b/s multiple instances. This kinda contradicts my
  previous commit of only "1" being supported, but it seems people play 1.10b
  for the +2 BKWB and then might move to 1.10f or another future patch.
  So I guess that I'll add support for any version that the community plays,
  even if it is in the same version number.
  
1.0.5
-------------------
- Removed 1.09b from Singling. Only one of each version will be supported (again). 1.09d has been chosen
since this patch has the most players in the SPF community.

1.0.4-r2
-------------------
- Removed the "Singling <Version>" from the Title Screens for 1.11-1.13

1.0.4-r1
-------------------
- Added limited support for versions 1.07, 1.08, 1.09b/d, and 1.10f by only including the modified D2gfx.dll.
  
1.0.4
-------------------
- Completely removed support for all versions before 1.11b.

1.0.3
-------------------
- Added support for the remaining patches expansion patches (Starting from 1.07 - One version of each patch was picked)
- Removed support for 1.09b (In accordance with the above - one version of each patch. This makes it easier for me to maintain as well)

1.0.2
-------------------
- Added 1.09b/d support. 1.09b/d now has colored runes and you can also open multiple copies of d2.

1.0.1
-------------------
- Experience.txt has been removed. Experience ratio is back to Vanilla. This mod is now equal to RWM + Modified dll all in one bundle.
