VERSION: 1.13d

CODE:

0000B6B0   74 45            JE SHORT 0000B6F7

WHAT TO DO:

Change 74 45 to EB 45, which will become JMP SHORT 0000B6F7

HOW TO FIND THE OFFSET:

I've noticed that when you search for the Binary String: 74 45

You will encounter a few 74 65, and then you will find one 74 45. The first 74 45 that you find, is the one.

1.13d Offset: B6B0
1.09b/d Offset: 447C (It's 74 4A for 1.09b and 74 47 for 1.09d, instead of the 1.13d 74 45)
