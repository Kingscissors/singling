------------------------------------------------

Installation:
-------------
1. Make sure to backup your current Diablo II directory before installing. 
   A simple copy/paste of your current Diablo II folder will do.

2. Extract and replace the following files into your Diablo II directory:

-> Patch_D2.mpq
-> D2gfx.dll

3. Enjoy.


Uninstallation:
---------------
Delete your Diablo II folder, and rename your old backup copy of Diablo II to 'Diablo II'.


Multiple D2 Clients:
---------------
To run multiple copies of D2 in 1.13d is easy. Just double click the 'Diablo II' shortcut on your desktop,
as many times as you want.

However, for 1.09d you need to make a shortcut that points to the 'Game.exe' file rather than the 'Diablo II.exe' file.
Once your Diablo II shortcut is opening up 'Game.exe', rather than 'Diablo II.exe' it will work.
